# Meshtastic-on-Wio-Tracker-L1
Meshtastic node/module based on Seeed Wio tracker L1 E-Ink dev board

Thanks to [Tomas Kuchta FPV](https://github.com/Tomas-Kuchta-FPV) I was finally able to put together my first Meshtastic device and one of my first projects here on github!
Well, it isn't anything special as you can see, but I'am planning to add temperature and humidity sensors to improve versatility. And to make this device somewhat special I'll maybe add a haptic feedback with fingerprint scanner, but not sure about these.

I also changed the incoming message notification sound (ring) using [RTTTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_Tone_Text_Transfer_Language) format with [this](https://1j01.github.io/rtttl.js/) library of melodies to further custmize my little mesh device.
I will also add the code for this thing once I'll know how to properly do it and also when this device reaches state where it isn't only a copy-paste thing.

## Currently features
- L74K GPS Module
- 2.13 inch E-Ink Display
- Custom beeps
